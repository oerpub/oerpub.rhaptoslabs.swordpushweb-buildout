OERPUB-REMIX is for importing, editing, and depositing educational documents, especially textbooks. The deposit 
protocol is based on SWORD and works with Connexions (cnx.org) currently. The application imports documents in Word, Open 
Office, LaTeX, Google Docs, or HTML format. Then an HTML5 editor, based on Aloha, is used to edit the documents. Finally, 
metadata is added, and then the document can be downloaded and saved locally, or uploaded to cnx.org for publishing as part
of an open textbook and educational resource library.

For more about the project as a whole (non technical) see our website: http://oerpub.org
